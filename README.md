Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

The client was Artemis Finanical. They wanted to modernize their operations while being protected from external threats to security. Secure communications weere esstential for Artemis Finanical as they provide specialized financial plans for its customers, including savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. It is important to ensure that such sensitive information cannot be attacked.


What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

 I  was able to address the concerns and vulnerabilities as they had and implement a plan to solve them. Coding securely is important in order to avoid collisions and attacks that could compromise the customer's personal data. Software security reflects directly on the company's reputability. A company that shows less concern for software security is at higher risks for malicious attacks.
 I think just learning how to process the vulnerabilites was difficult at first. I did not understand what I was looking at. 

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

To increase layers of security, I implemented hashing with SHA-256 to ensure that sensitive data could not be exposed. In the future, I would continue to use vulnerability scanners like OWASP to identify vulnernerabilities, conduct penetration testing and continuously evaluate risks.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments 
or tasks?
Using tools such as OWASP Dependency Check ensures that communications with third party libraries were secure and up to date. Running these dependency checks each time a vulnerability was addressed ensures that if any new vulnerabilities were introduced, they could be addressed accordingly.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I would show my future employer how I was able to access my vulnerabilites and refactor them by using a supression file. I would show how I used my problem-solving skills to come out with an asnwer even when I was not sure what I was doing. I would show how I implemented SHA_256.
